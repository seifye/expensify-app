/* import a utility library to make enzyme work with snapshot testing functionality. We use the toJSON method which takes the enzyme wrapper in toJSON in order to extract just the meaningful stuff from the rendered output and leaving the enzyme stuff away. So when we try to use toMatchScreenshot(), we just compare the meaningful stuff which is located in the _snapshots_ folder. we will automate this process by defining this 'enzyme-to-json' library in the jest config file*/
